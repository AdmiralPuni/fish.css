# fish.css
Small SImple Stylesheet, modifiable stylssheet, organized into parts, some part can be removed for further reduction in size.

Modern 'web design' has come to a path of bloat, slapping everything in there until it looks 'pretty'. This stylesheet aims to avoid abominations like this :

Call me insane if I think that this stylesheet is perfect for almost everything, with some modifications. Do you really need that much javascript just to make the site run as 
your designer wished? screw them, this is perfect.

The more complex the website is the harder it is to be fixed, this thing, you can understand everything in them, the comments might be not perfect yet but it is readable by your own eye 
if you cannot even understand what you're using or even modify it, why bother.
